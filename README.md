User Registration and Login: 
Users can register for an account and subsequently log in using their credentials.

Session Expiry Mechanism: 
The system incorporates a sessionCreatedAt field to track the timestamp when a user registers or logs in. 
If 300 seconds have passed since the session creation, the user is prompted to log in again.
